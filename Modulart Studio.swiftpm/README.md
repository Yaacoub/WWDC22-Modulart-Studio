## To-do before running

- You may please set the destination as "My Mac (Designed for iPad)" and run the app on fullscreen for the best possible experience.

## Things to consider

- Building this project, studying for my official exams, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Doing all that was not easy, but I pushed myself to do my best on all three!
- While coding, I revisited trigonometry and modularity formulas. Besides, I also discovered new mathematical fields and concepts.
- Most used images, excluding SFSymbols icons, have been generated by the project's image export feature.
- Using SwiftUI's ColorPicker view was producing bugs. Therefore I created a custom color picker for this project. By manipulating colors throughout the project, I learned a lot about tinting, shading, luminance, mixing, and contrast ratios to make the experience more accessible to visually impaired users.

## Known issues

- FB9987563 - A weird saturation bug seems to occur randomly for macOS apps designed for iPad where colors (mainly reds) would get saturated then go back to normal. It may also be a problem with colorspace handling.
- FB9987609 - The animation of paths inside the GeometryReader does not correspond to the animation of its parent view when resized.
- FB9987617 - The window title on macOS does not accurately reflect the navigation bar's current title.

I submitted the feedback report for each of these issues, providing as much practicable information as possible.
